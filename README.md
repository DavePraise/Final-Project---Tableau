# Final-Project---Tableau

## Project Overview
This tableau project was my final project for my Business Intelligence course while I was completing my Masters degree in Business Analytics at the University of Akron. It is a scenario based project where I was asked to analyze a topic, create a data visualization on it using Tableau and present it as part of a job interview. I chose to investigate whether or not education impacts hardship and I visualized my analysis/findings using an interactive map.
